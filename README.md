I don't think I realized until learning about and building the program, just how many apps still function when offline.  I think that is the whole poiint.  Using the PWA method you can create an app that will continue to function even when internet connectivity is low or even turned off.  This allows users to have a seemless experience with your app no matter where or when they use it.

## Why did you build this?

- I built this app in order to have a simple way for someone to track their daily expenses.  I think a lot of times people think they will get caught up later if they can't connect to the internet or have slow service.  Making the it a Progressive Web Application or PWA as they are called, allows people to use it any time with easy.  This make it much easier to keep track of all of your dail spending and really see the trends via the graph to recognize if you are spending too much or if you are on track and saving money.

- Building this was very satisfying to say the least.  Knowing you made something that can actually be used by others whether they are online or off is very satisfying.

## Installation and testing

To install the program you would download the repository.  Then using your terminal you can enter "npm start".  At that point in your browser you can visit localhost:3001.  From there I did my testing by using the inspect page feature by right clicking on the page and choosing "inspect".  From there you can navigate to the "Network" tab at the top and make sure that it still works when you disconnect your browser from the internet.  This is also where you can use the "Console" tab to make sure all of your files are loading correctly.

## How do you use the program?

This may be the easiest to use App I have made to this point in my coding journey.  Once you can open the page you simply start at Zero and then as you either have money coming in or out of your wallet you just use "Name of transaction" and enter the specified amount.  You will then either click "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" depending on whether you are earning or being given money or spending it.

### What language or programs did you use?

For the program we used Heroku for deployment alsong with Mongo, Git Hub for the repository, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSON.  We also used Service workers for the first time.

### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I think it would be interesting to try and add some features like viewing the balance for only a specific amount of time.  It would also be interesting to learn how much you can add but still have it work as well as it does in its current state.

### What did you learn while building this?

I learned a great deal about how to make an app or website run as efficiently as possible.  I also never really even knew that many apps worked offline.  I think I just always assumed I had a connection but that is the whole goal of something like this.  We try to create an app that continues to function properly no matter where or when so that the user doesn't get annoyed with load times or having to restart because they lost a connection.
